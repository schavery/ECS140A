Overall:

Needed to modify the run command for part5 and part6, since a.out is not being found,
it needs to execute ./a.out instead


Question #1: What is the purpose of putback?

'putback' is used to recognize comments made in the e
language, and not read anything after these comments until
a new line character '\n' is found.
'putback' is a boolean used to identify the end of a line
of code. It is set to true when the scanner encounter '\n'
the end of a line.


Question #2: What are the values of putback and c just before
the identifier 'hello' is returned from the input 'hello*45'?

putback is true
c is \n


Question #3: What does the following case and the code in it do?

The cases are used to identify the character held by the
variable 'c' as either a single char token, or a two char token.
ccaselor2 and ccase2 are called 
In each case, depending on the value of c, there can be double
meanings behind the character token, such as '/', this could
either be recognized as a divide symbol, or if there is a '='
right after, it can be recognized as a 'not equals' symbol.
These methods determine what the character is used as.
